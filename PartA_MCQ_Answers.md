## PART 1: Agricultural Marketplace (Real-World African Context)

**Scenario:** You are hired as a blockchain developer to build a decentralised agricultural marketplace for African farmers. The platform must:

- Allow farmers to list produce as NFTs with quality certificates  
- Enable buyers to swap tokens for produce using a DEX  
- Store farmer reputation scores transparently  
- Process payments without intermediaries  

---

### Question 1: Architecture Decision (Technical Reasoning)

**Which combination of technologies demonstrates the best understanding of blockchain fundamentals for this use case?**

- **A)** Use ERC-721 for each produce item, build a centralised database for reputation, and integrate Binance for payments because CEXs have better liquidity.  
- **B)** Use ERC-1155 for produce items (enabling batch listings from farmers), implement reputation as on-chain mappings in the marketplace smart contract, and integrate with a DEX like Uniswap for direct farmer-to-buyer swaps to minimise intermediaries.  
- **C)** Use ERC-721 exclusively, store all data off-chain for gas savings, and require buyers to use MetaMask with manual price negotiations.  
- **D)** Build everything as separate NFT collections with no DEX integration since farmers won't understand DeFi protocols.  

**Your Answer:** [A/B/C/D]

### Question 2: Cost Optimisation (Practical Aptitude)

A farmer wants to list 50 bags of maize. Gas costs are:

- **ERC-721:** 100,000 gas per NFT mint  
- **ERC-1155:** 150,000 gas for first mint + 5,000 gas per additional item in batch  

**Current gas price:** 20 gwei  
**1 ETH = $3,000**

**What is the gas cost difference between ERC-721 and ERC-1155 for listing 50 items?**

- **A)** ERC-721 is cheaper by $15  
- **B)** ERC-1155 is cheaper by approximately $27  
- **C)** They cost exactly the same  
- **D)** ERC-1155 is cheaper by approximately $54  

**Your Answer:** [A/B/C/D]  

**Your Calculation/Reasoning:**  
- ERC-721 cost = [Show calculation]
- ERC-1155 cost = [Show calculation]
- Difference = [Show calculation]

### Question 3: Value Proposition Explanation (Communication & Thinking)

A farmer asks: *"Why can't we just use a normal website with a database?"*

**Which response demonstrates understanding of blockchain's actual value (not just its technology)?**

- **A)** "Blockchain is the future; everyone should use it."  
- **B)** "With blockchain, no middleman can manipulate your pricing or payment records. If a buyer claims they paid but you didn't receive funds, the blockchain provides immutable proof. Plus, your reputation score can follow you to other platforms since it's on-chain – it's your data, not the platform's."  
- **C)** "Because smart contracts are more secure than databases and Web3 is decentralised."  
- **D)** "Blockchain uses cryptography which makes it unhackable, unlike normal databases."  

**Your Answer:** [A/B/C/D]

## PART 2: DeFi & NFT Integration (Advanced Concepts)

**Scenario:** A DeFi protocol experiences the following sequence of events:

- A liquidity provider adds 10 ETH and 20,000 USDC to an AMM pool (constant product formula: x × y = k)  
- A trader swaps 2 ETH for USDC (no fees for simplicity)  
- The protocol's governance token holders vote on implementing impermanent loss protection  
- An NFT marketplace integrates with the DEX to enable ERC-1155 token swaps  

---

### Question: Multi-Concept Synthesis

**Which statement correctly combines understanding of AMMs, governance, and technical implementation?**

- **A)** After the 2 ETH swap, the liquidity provider will have exactly the same USD value as before because the constant product formula maintains equal ratios. ERC-1155 tokens cannot be traded on AMMs since they support both fungible and non-fungible characteristics.  
- **B)** The trader will receive approximately 3,333 USDC from the swap (calculated using k = 10 × 20,000 = 200,000, then 12 × y = 200,000). Impermanent loss protection would compensate the LP for price divergence between the pool ratio and external market prices. ERC-1155's batch transfer capability makes it more gas-efficient than ERC-721 for marketplace integration.  
- **C)** The liquidity provider experiences impermanent loss because the pool maintains a constant product rather than constant ratio. ERC-721 would be more suitable than ERC-1155 for the NFT marketplace since individual NFTs require unique transactions.  
- **D)** The constant product formula prevents any impermanent loss by automatically rebalancing. DAOs cannot implement financial protections due to smart contract immutability. ERC-1155 tokens are incompatible with standard DEX protocols.  

**Your Answer:** [A/B/C/D]  

**Your Reasoning:**  

- **AMM Mathematics:** How do you calculate the swap output? What happens to the liquidity provider's value?  
- **DeFi Governance:** What is impermanent loss and how does protection work?  
- **Token Standards:** Why might ERC-1155 be preferred over ERC-721 for marketplace integration?
