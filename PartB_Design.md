## WHY I BUILT IT THIS WAY

### 1. Data Structure Choices
**Explain your design decisions for BOTH contracts:**
- When would you choose to use a `mapping` instead of an `array`?
- How did you structure your state variables in `SkillsMarketplace` vs `SecureLottery`?
- What trade-offs did you consider for storage efficiency?

### 2. Security Measures
**What attacks did you protect against in BOTH implementations?**
- Reentrancy attacks? (Explain your implementation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern)
- Access control vulnerabilities?
- Integer overflow/underflow?
- Front-running/Randomness manipulation (specifically for `SecureLottery`)?

### 3. Trade-offs & Future Improvements
**What would you change with more time?**
- Gas optimization opportunities?
- Additional features (e.g., dispute resolution, multiple prize tiers)?
- Better error handling?

## REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENT CONCERNS

### 1. Gas Costs
**Analyze the viability of your contracts for real-world use:**
- Estimated gas for key functions (e.g., `postGig`, `selectWinner`).
- Is this viable for users in constrained environments (e.g., high gas fees)?
- Any specific optimization strategies you implemented?

### 2. Scalability
**What happens with 10,000+ entries/gigs?**
- Performance considerations for loops or large arrays.
- Storage cost implications.
- Potential bottlenecks in `selectWinner` or `applyForGig`.

### User Experience

**How would you make this usable for non-crypto users?**
- Onboarding process?
- MetaMask alternatives?
- Mobile accessibility?
